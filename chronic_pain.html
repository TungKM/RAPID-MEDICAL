                <h2>What is Chronic Pain?</h2>
                <p>Pain is a sensation that is uncomfortable or unpleasant. While acute pain occurs suddenly and has a specific and identifiable cause, chronic pain lasts for a long time, usually more than six months. It is estimated that over a quarter of American adults have chronic pain.

                    The presence of chronic pain can greatly reduce the enjoyment of life, by altering the range of activities, interfering with normal routines, preventing proper sleep, and depressing the mood.</p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Acute pain can become chronic pain if not properly treated. The greater the duration of untreated pain, the higher the chances of chronic pain are.

                    Pain lasting beyond three months is considered to be chronic pain. With chronic pain, the pain may be constant or it may wax and wane. Sometimes, the cause of chronic pain is unidentifiable. It may continue to hurt even after the original cause no longer exists.
                    
                    When the nerve signals that cause pain persist in the nervous system for too long a period, they can modify the nerves or the brain to become hypersensitive to the pain, or to interpret other nerve signals as pain. Chronic pain is often found to occur with medical conditions such as headache, arthritis, nerve pain, back pain, neuralgia, and cancer. The result is often stress.
                    
                    Stress, in turn, manifests as tense muscles, restriction of movement, low energy levels, and loss of or gain in appetite. The patient is often depressed, anxious and over-cautious because of the fear of further injury. Sometimes the mood may be angry.
                    
                    Insomnia may supervene, aggravating the pain due to the resulting tiredness and frustration. This vicious cycle may be hard to break. The John Hopkins website calls this the “terrible triad" of suffering, sleeplessness, and sadness.”

                <h3>Causes</h3>
                <p>
                    With illnesses like cancer or arthritis, the cause of chronic pain may seem to be obvious. However, sometimes injuries and disease processes cause invisible or subtle changes to the body that increases its pain sensitivity. This residual effect may be the cause of chronic pain even after the injury has healed.

Psychogenic or psychosomatic pain is another cause of chronic pain and is typically found in association with stress, anxiety, and depression. The underlying mechanism may be the low endorphin levels in the blood. Endorphins are natural pain-relieving molecules that trigger positive feelings.

Sometimes chronic pain may be caused by multiple conditions as well. The type of pain experienced may range from aching, burning, shooting, or stinging to throbbing or tightening pain.
