                <h3>What is Long COVID?</h3>
                <p>Whilst COVID-19 symptoms subside in the majority of patients after a couple of weeks, there is an emerging group of people who suffer long-term effects of the infection.

                    This newly emerging condition has been dubbed long COVID and describes people who experience prolonged symptoms for 4 weeks or longer. Affecting about one-in-five people who test positive for COVID-19, the implications and consequences of the syndrome present a growing global health concern.</p>

                <h3>What is long COVID?</h3>

                <p>
                    The majority of people who become infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will go on to develop mild to moderate COVID-19 and will recover fully in 2-4 weeks.

                    A small proportion of people, currently thought to be approximately 20% of those infected, continue to suffer with symptoms for weeks or months post-infection. In the UK, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) use the following clinical definitions to distinguish the initial infection and disease at different time points:
                    
                    Acute COVID-19: Symptoms lasting up to 4 weeks.
                    Ongoing symptomatic COVID-19: Symptoms lasting between 4 and 12 weeks.
                    Post-COVID-19 syndrome: Symptoms that develop during or after SARS-CoV-2 infection that last over 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis.
                    Although experiencing symptoms for longer than 4 weeks only appears to affect about one-fifth of those who develop COVID-19, given the sheer number of total infections, long COVID will have a profound effect on individuals and healthcare systems.
                    
                    In August 2020, the British Medical Association issued a press release to draw attention to the prevalence of long COVID and outlining the long-term risk that SARS-CoV-2 presents to the National Health Service, healthcare staff and patients. Other health institutions such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have also brought attention to the long term effects of COVID-19.
